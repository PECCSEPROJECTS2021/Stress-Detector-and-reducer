
      STRESS DETECTOR AND REDUCER WEARABLE DEVICE USING IOT

The following steps illustrates the working of our project
STEP 1: Detect the sensor values using Microcontroller 1
STEP 2:Collect the sensor values and using WIFI Module display in webpage and android application
STEP 3: If the stress is detected then using RF Transmitter pass the signal to the RF Receiver
STEP 4:Then with RF Receiver pass the signal to Microcontroller 2
STEP 5: Microcontroller allow the IR LED to glow and penetrate into skin
STEP 6:Stress is reduced now and collect the sensor values 
STEP 7:Display the collected sensor values in android application and LED Display
